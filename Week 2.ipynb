    "\n",
    "Garbage collection in Python refers to the automatic process of reclaiming memory that is no longer in use by the program. It helps manage memory by identifying and disposing of objects that are no longer needed, preventing memory leaks.\n",
    "Python uses a combination of reference counting and a cyclic garbage collector to handle memory:\n",
    "\n",
    "Reference counting: Every object in Python has a reference count. Each time an object is referenced, its count increases, and when a reference is removed, the count decreases. When the count reaches zero, the object is deallocated.\n",

    "\n",
    "1. Data Type Consistency:\n",
    "Python Lists: Lists can contain elements of different data types, such as integers, floats, strings, etc., within the same list.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: NumPy arrays require that all elements be of the same data type. This allows for more efficient memory usage and better performance, especially in numerical operations.\n",
    "2. Memory Efficiency:\n",
    "Python Lists: Lists in Python are more memory-intensive because each element in the list is a reference to an object, which adds overhead.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: NumPy arrays store elements in a contiguous block of memory, allowing much more efficient memory usage. This leads to faster access times and reduced memory consumption, especially for large datasets.\n",
    "3. Performance:\n",
    "Python Lists: When performing operations on lists, Python often has to loop through the elements, which can be slow when working with large datasets.\n",
    "NumPy Arrays: NumPy arrays are optimized for performance and allow element-wise operations to be performed directly on the array without looping. NumPy uses highly efficient C-based implementations that make numerical computations much faster than Python's native lists."
